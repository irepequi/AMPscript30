    <p>Hi %%=v(@fullName)=%%,</p>

    <p>
      As we enjoy the remaining days of summer, it's time to think about getting your vehicle ready for fall adventures and winter road trips. Now is a great time to check major components like tires, brakes and batteries to help give you confidence on the roads as the days get shorter and the weather begins to change.
    </p>

    <p>Here are recommended services:</p>
    %%[
      IF @servicesCount > 0 THEN
      FOR @counter = 1 to @servicesCount DO
        VAR @service, @serviceName, @serviceDescription

        SET @service = row(@services, @counter)
        SET @serviceName = field(@service,'Name')
        SET @serviceDescription = field(@service,'Description')
    ]%%

    <p>%%=v(@serviceName)=%% %%=v(@serviceDescription)=%%</p>

    %%[ 
      NEXT @counter 
      ELSE RaiseError('No rows found', true)
      ENDIF 
    ]%%
